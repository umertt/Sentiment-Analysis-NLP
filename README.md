This project is a simple Sentiment Analysis implementation using Python and NLP techniques. It processes text data and classifies sentiments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Features
Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)

Sentiment classification using basic NLP/ML models

Requirements
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Matplotlib 
Install all dependencies with: pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git && cd sentiment-analysis

Open the notebook: jupyter notebook "Sentiment Analysis.ipynb"

Run all cells to preprocess text and classify sentiments.

File Structure
Sentiment Analysis.ipynb â€“ Main Jupyter notebook with code and outputs

Future Improvements
Train on a larger dataset for better accuracy

Use deep learning models like LSTM or transformers

Deploy as a simple web app for real-time sentiment prediction
